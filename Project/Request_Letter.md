Subject: Examination of the Recent Airline Delays Data





Hello DBA Team,

Our team is poised to undertake a comprehensive analysis of the airline delays data specifically for the months of December in the years 2019 and 2020. This dataset is extensive and has numerous columns. For a more effective analysis, we need to first normalize the dataset into multiple tables. Once this is done, please address the following queries:

1. Identify the airline with the highest average delay.
2. Determine the top 5 carriers in terms of frequency of delays.
3. Ascertain the most frequent reason for delays.
4. List the top 5 airports with the greatest number of cancellations.
5. Calculate the total delays experienced annually.
6. Analyze the proportions of delayed versus on-time flights for each airline.
7. Provide a breakdown of delays by cause on an annual basis.
8. Find out which airport experiences the least amount of delay.

Your efforts in this analysis are greatly appreciated.



Best regards,

Lawrence
